# Python Practice Repository 🐍

Welcome to my Python practice repository! 👋

This repository contains Python scripts and code snippets that I have written while learning the Python programming language. It's a personal space to track my progress and experiments.

## 📌 What you'll find here:
- Basic syntax and variables
- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- File handling
- Object-oriented programming
- And more as I continue learning!

## 🧠 Purpose
This repo is meant for **learning and practicing** Python. All code is beginner-friendly and constantly evolving as I explore new concepts.
